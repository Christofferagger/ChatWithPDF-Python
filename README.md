# Chat With any PDF
Using this script you can chat with multiple PDF files and your chat history will be saved. 

There are many scripts like this out there and I have taken much inspiration from [here](https://github.com/viniciusarruda/chatpdf)

Loom demo:

## Run the script
1. Run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To install the necessary requirements.

2. Rename the .env.example file by executing the following command:
   ```shell
   mv .env.example .env

3. Replace "Your-OpenAI-Key-Here" with your OpenAI API key in the re-named .env

4. Run the script
